In this case study you have to:

Create page where:
1. User will see text: "What's your name?"
2. In input user will write his name
3. after pressing button user will see alert that says: "Hello <userName>"
   e.g.:![img_1.png](img_1.png)
4. when user will not provide name (if input is empty) alert should not be rendered
5. user should also see his name bellow input, e.g. "Previous name: <userName>"

Tip: <br/>
use `alert()` for greeting user (:
