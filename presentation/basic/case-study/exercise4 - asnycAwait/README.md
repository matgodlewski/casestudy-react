In this case study you have to:

Create page where:

1. Use async/await in this case study
2. On page render text 'Late answer: [answer]' and button
3. When user will click on button, use `mockedApi` to get response -- (response is delayed by few sec)
4. When `mockedApi` returns response, display `message` in page: 'Late answer: [message]'
5. While waiting for `mockedApi` to returns response, show 'fetching...' text on page and hide it, when response is returned
6. If api returns error, it should be displayed in console
